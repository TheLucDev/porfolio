        <p>
          Hi, I'm The Luc, a dedicated and enthusiastic Full Stack Developer
          with > <strong>1.5 years</strong> of professional experience in
          crafting dynamic and responsive web applications. My journey in web
          development has been driven by a passion for technology and a
          commitment to continuous learning and improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, where I gained a
          solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development. My skill
          set includes proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular
          frameworks like <b>React</b> and <b>NextJS</b> , <b>VueJs</b> on the
          front-end, as well as <b>Node.js</b>, <b>Express.js</b>, and
          <b>NestJs</b> on the back-end. I am also experienced in working with
          databases such as <strong>MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my career, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of
          projects, ranging from small business websites to complex web
          applications. I've developed a keen eye for detail and a strong
          ability to solve problems efficiently. One of my key strengths is my
          adaptability, allowing me to quickly learn and implement new
          technologies and methodologies to meet project requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working closely with
          cross-functional teams to bring innovative ideas to life. My
          experience includes implementing user authentication, creating
          <b>RESTful</b> <b>APIs</b>, optimizing application performance, and
          ensuring security best practices. I am also well-versed in version
          control using <b>Git</b> and continuous integration/deployment
          <b>(CI/CD)</b>
          pipelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond my technical skills, I am a proactive communicator and a strong
          advocate for clean, maintainable code. I believe in the power of code
          reviews and pair programming to foster knowledge sharing and improve
          code quality. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities
          to grow as a developer and contribute to impactful projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends,
          contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying outdoor activities.
          I am excited about the future of web development and look forward to
          being a part of innovative and transformative projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore my projects
          and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my
          work.
